# FunCaB
### _The role of Functional group interactions in mediating climate change impacts on the Carbon dynamics and Biodiversity of alpine ecosystems_



#### Objectives:

 - Experimentally assess the effects of temperature and precipitation on the composition and functional groups of alpine ecosystems
 - Quantify the impacts and contributions of direct climatic effects vs. indirect effects (through changes in interactions among functional groups)
 - Use an Earth System Model to understand the patterns functional diversity and consequences for ecosystem C dynamics and climate feedbacks under different future climate scenarios.
