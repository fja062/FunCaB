## R Markdown

These are the figures so far for the seedling manuscript. Comments welcome.

```{r}
seedTotPlot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tempLevel, y = perChange, colour = Treatment)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", na.rm = TRUE, position = position_dodge(width = 0.2), size = 1) +
  geom_boxplot()
scale_shape_manual(values = c(21,24)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("grey40", "darkgoldenrod3"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
